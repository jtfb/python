The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[ 3.15447393e+02 -2.32846184e+02  1.94756102e+01  1.91251310e+02\n"," -2.30940325e+00  4.81874921e+02  8.45970147e+01  9.45291663e+01\n","  1.56143893e+01  9.47370089e+01  3.60178511e+01  1.45149560e+02\n","  5.27879829e+02  6.51480927e+02  2.34984711e+02  1.24139019e+02\n","  2.48604144e+02  4.32836242e+02  8.51485575e+01  4.57000888e+01\n","  9.22431003e+01  3.45515828e+02  2.14124288e+02  7.12025083e+02\n","  3.24652043e+02  6.55195061e+02  1.25591959e+02  7.17682011e+02\n","  9.85715495e+02  1.17058679e+03  1.38189577e+03  1.17001950e+03\n","  1.28447523e+03  1.15239402e+03  1.44319101e+03  1.76608348e+03\n","  1.85128929e+03  2.18775766e+03  2.09637119e+03  2.29167820e+03\n","  2.68674792e+03  2.53012964e+03  2.80822709e+03  2.84987165e+03\n","  3.20655733e+03  3.77931475e+03  4.21847817e+03  4.68347575e+03\n","  4.57522757e+03  5.12539028e+03]\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","# set initial population\n","N0 = 100\n","\n","# set growth rate\n","rate = 0.4\n","\n","# Create an array of time points\n","t = np.arange(0, 10, 0.2)\n","\n","# Create a population size\n","population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate * t)\n","\n","#Create a noise\n","population_size_noise = population_size + np.random.normal(0, 250, np.shape(population_size))\n","\n","print(population_size_noise)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
